MWeZForms 1.0 installation

0. Get the extension 
Go to your `extension` folder within your eZ installation, then run:
git clone git@github.com:bogdanjuszczak/mwezforms.git

1. Enable extension adding entry to site.ini.append.php:
[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]=mwezforms

2. Log in to admin panel as administrator, go to Setup -> Packages and click "Import new package". 
Now browse for package which is included in mwezforms/package and import it. 
After successfull import process, you will be asked to install package, so please perform.
In case of any errors please check if proper file rights write are set on your `var` folder.

3. To check if everything went OK, go to Setup -> Classes. You should see "MWForm" class as a first item of "Recently modified classes" list.

4. Now you need to include PHP class, so go to the root directory of your eZ installation and run:
php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php

5. It's also highly recommended to clear the cache, but be aware of running this on your production environment:
php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all --purge

6. As forms requires changes in your MySQL database, you need to install sql file included in extension (sql/update.sql). You can use following pattern as a instalation command:
mysql -u {mysql-username} -p {your-ezpublish-database} < update.sql

7. If you have editor users in your project and you want them to have a possibility to add/remove forms, you need to grant them proper privilages.
Go to User accounts => Roles and policies and click on your editor's group. Now click "Edit" button and add "New policy".
As a module please select "mwezforms" and choose "create" function. Then accept it by clicking "Grant full access". You can perform same action for "remove" function.

8. Additionaly, if you want to have AJAX (ezjscore) form validation, you need to add following privilages to Anonymous user group:
module: ezjscore, function: call, function limitation: mwezforms

9. Now you can use "mwezforms" tab, which is displayed in your admin panel. After you will create your form, you can assign it to MWForm class object. 
It is also possible to add MWForm attribute (datatype) into your own class.

Troubles...
If "mwezforms" tab loads blank page, please be sure that you have cleared the cache. Perform clearing from the admin panel once more.
