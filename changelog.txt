Below you can find what changed in each version. Version number convention is based basically on changes made to database structure. In case when we made some changes in 
database structure we're incrementing number after first decimal (i.e 1.1, 1.2). Otherwise we're incrementing the number after second decimal (i.e 1.2.1, 1.2.2).
